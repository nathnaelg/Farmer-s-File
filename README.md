## Project Synopsis

### Problem Statement:
Many farmers struggle to maintain accurate records of their land use, crop yields, and assets. This hinders their ability to secure financing, insurance, and legal protections. The lack of documentation limits access to vital resources and support necessary for sustainable farming practices.

### Planned Solution:
We are developing a digital record book platform linked to each farmer's Fayda ID. This platform will enable farmers to log and manage their agricultural data efficiently, including:

- Land size and boundaries  
- Crop rotation schedules  
- Yields per season  
- Equipment usage and maintenance records  

The platform will also offer report generation features that farmers can use for financing and insurance applications, simplifying the process.

### Expected Outcome:
- Improved access to financing and insurance through accurate, verifiable records  
- Enhanced farm productivity via better planning and resource management  
- Increased financial literacy and confidence among farmers  
- Stronger legal standing for land ownership and usage  

### Fayda's Role (Recommended):
Fayda will provide the digital identity infrastructure crucial to this solution by:

- Offering a secure ID system for farmers to access and manage their data  
- Enabling integrations with banks and insurers to verify records  
- Supporting users with training and technical assistance  

## Tech Stack:
- **Frontend:** Flutter  
- **Backend:** Golang (Gin/Fiber for REST, or gRPC for performance)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL or SQLite (with support for syncing)
- **Auth & Identity:** Fayda ID integration (through OAuth2 or SSO with Fayda’s system)
- **Hosting:** Render, Railway, or Fly.io for Go APIs
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
